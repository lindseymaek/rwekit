\arguments{
\item{d}{A dataframe}

\item{model.method}{String containing target model. Options are "glm_binomial", "glm_gaussian", and "survival_coxph".}

\item{outcome.var}{String containing the name of the outcome variable present in d.}

\item{time.var}{String containing the name of the time variable present in d. Must be specified if "survival_coxph" is selected.}

\item{model.vars}{Vector of strings containing the names of independent model variables for which bivariate analysis will be performed.}

\item{report.inverse}{A vector of strings containing the names of independent model variables for which the inverse of the estimate is desired for reporting.}

\item{round.estimate}{An integer representing the number of places to which the model estimate and confidence intervals are rounded.}

\item{p.round.method}{integer corresponding to desired rounding convention. See Details.}

\item{p.lead.zero}{if FALSE, no 0 will be reported in the place before the decimal. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean: if TRUE (Default), see messages about model outputs warning of possible common errors.}

\item{conf.level}{The confidence level for the intervals passed to tidy() from the broom package. Default = 0.95}
}
\value{
A dataframe with an labeled model summary
}
\description{
Bivariate modeling is performed independently for each variable in a vector of supplied predictors with options to format reported output.
}
\details{
# p.round.method
Two methods are currently defined. Select 1 (default) to round values above 0.10 to two digits. Select 2 to round values above 0.10 to 1 digit.
APA format is equivalent to method=1 when lead.zero=FALSE.
